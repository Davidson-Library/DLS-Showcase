												<p style="font-style: italic;">In this episode, we delve into how joy is influenced by race, space, culture, and belonging. Through the lens of our campus, we'll explore the distinction between collective and individual joy, examine the impact of racial dynamics, and reflect on what it means to experience joy in a world shaped by systems of inclusion and exclusion. We'll gather insights from current students and discuss the importance of creating and preserving safe spaces. We'll also tackle some crucial questions: What does it mean to have access to joy, and why is it so important? Our exploration reveals the deep, nuanced ways that race, gender, and community intersect to shape emotional experiences at Davidson. While joy might seem like a universal emotion, our findings show how access to joy—and the spaces where it thrives—are often filtered through systems of privilege and marginalization. Reflections from students who participated in our survey highlight the need for inclusive spaces that honor diverse experiences and support all students' ability to thrive. By acknowledging the systemic barriers to joy and fostering intentional, equitable communities, we can work toward a campus culture where joy is not a privilege, but a shared and accessible experience for all.</p>
